       "Hey folks, so Microsoft just released the 5.4 multimodal model earlier today, and I spent the last two hours just sort of putting it through its paces, and I think it's really, really good. So right off the bat, the first thing to know is that it's fully multimodal on the input side. So what that means is that the same model can take in text, images, audio tokens, reason about them, and sort of generate text as conditions and all of that. The second important thing is that it's quite small, so it's 5.4 billion parameters. The implication here is that it can be optimized around the world. So in the blog post here, it talks about how it delivers highly efficient low latency inference, all while optimizing for on-device execution and reduce computational overhead. So overall, the model can do a lot of things. So you can do text generation, image description, captioning, audio transcription, text transcription, function calling, OCR, and in this video, we're going to test out all of that. So let's head over to a Jupyter notebook and sort of take a look. Okay, so here I have a Jupyter notebook that I've put together to illustrate all of the core capabilities of this model. And I'll put a link to this in the description. So the first thing to know is that like 5.4 is released with a specific set of dependencies, so a specific torch, flash attention, all the stuff. So the first thing you want to do is to create a virtual environment and sort of install all these things in order. And then once we have a bunch of inputs, and I've written some code scaffolding just to make it just a little easier to run inference. I'm doing all of these on a local A6000 GPU, but it probably work really well on any consumer GPU that you have. So the first function I have is just a generic interface that can take a persistent prompt, a content list, and it will do all of the inference. So essentially construct the prompt correctly, figure out images, audio tokens, put them in the right order, pass them through the model, and sort of give us a response. And then we have some utilities to sort of print out results, not very important. So let's let's head over to the first task. And so here we just going to look at text-only conversation, and we're going to ask it a funny question, who is Victor DBA and what is he known for? So if we run that, can look at the response. So here it says like Victor DBA is a Nigerian-born American scientist, says a lot of things, makes up all kinds of stuff. None of this is correct. This is just a reminder that models at this size, just because how small they are, you probably should not be using them for factual queries or factual use cases. And the actual the right thing to do here would be to instead give it context. So in this case, what I've done is that I went to my website and I took in all of the text and I added that as context in the first message. Then I asked it who is Victor DBA, what is he known for? And we can look at the response. So here is like, Victor DBA is an expert in applied machine learning, he's a researcher at Microsoft, he's here, all of his papers, all of that. And all of this is all correct. I think it sort of looked at the important tidy parts of that text, and actually the text there is actually a message, a bunch of stuff, really unorganized, but the model is able to sort of look through all of that, come up with a sensible summary, which makes sense. And all of that took about 11 seconds on this particular machine. Okay, all good. We give it a win there. Next we head over to image description. And so here I have a couple of images. And so this is an image from a blog post I wrote a while ago, and we'll see what the image looks so far like. And what we just do is that we give it as the first message in the prompt, and then we tell it what is shown in this image. And this is what the image looks like. It's just like an illustration from an article I wrote about like AI fatigue. And this is actually not particularly like a naturally occurring image, but let's see how the model describes that. And so here it says the image depicts a man sitting on the floor with a large battery pack on his head, which kind of makes sense, connected to a power outlet, give her symbols and numbers floating around him and it reads, your search capacity is depleted, depleted. That makes sense. Pretty decent OCR, not very hard, but all fairly enough for a fairly small model, and this took about 4 seconds. Let's see. The next thing we head over to another type of image. And so here again, an abstract kind of image. And let's see how the model does. It says the image depicts a man running on a treadmill, while papers labeled new model updates, which is kind of correct, new model, updates, show, vome, all of that. It's kind of flying off the treadmill and onto the floor. Demands appears to be in a hurry or stressed, which kind of makes sense. It's exactly in the spirit of the illustration here. I gave it another pass, pretty good. The next thing would be just a little bit more challenging. And so here we take a snapshot from a website with just a bunch of text. And so this is a technical specification for a smartphone. And essentially we want the model to sort of extract all of this text. And the query here is extract all the text from this image and render it in a neat markdown file. And this is what comes out of the model, just a lot of text in a markdown file. So just a good instruction following here. It's doing markdown. The next thing would be just a little bit more challenging. And so here we take a snapshot from a website with just a bunch of text.

       " \"Hey folks, so Microsoft just released the 5.4 multimodal model earlier today, and I spent the last two hours just sort of putting it through its paces, and I think it's really, really good. So right off the bat, the first thing to know is that it's fully multimodal on the input side. So what that means is that the same model can take in text, images, audio tokens, reason about them, and sort of generate text as conditions and all of that. The second important thing is that it's quite small, so it's 5.4 billion parameters. The implication here is that it can be optimized around the world. So in the blog post here, it talks about how it delivers highly efficient low latency inference, all while optimizing for on-device execution and reduce computational overhead. So overall, the model can do a lot of things. So you can do text generation, image description, captioning, audio transcription, text transcription, function calling, OCR, and in this video, we're going to test out all of that. So let's head over to a Jupyter notebook and sort of take a look. Okay, so here I have a Jupyter notebook that I've put together to illustrate all of the core capabilities of this model. And I'll put a link to this in the description. So the first thing to know is that like 5.4 is released with a specific set of dependencies, so a specific torch, flash attention, all the stuff. So the first thing you want to do is to create a virtual environment and sort of install all these things in order. And then once we have a bunch of inputs, and I've written some code scaffolding just to make it just a little easier to run inference. I'm doing all of these on a local A6000 GPU, but it probably work really well on any consumer GPU that you have. So the first function I have is just a generic interface that can take a persistent prompt, a content list, and it will do all of the inference. So essentially construct the prompt correctly, figure out images, audio tokens, put them in the right order, pass them through the model, and sort of give us a response. And then we have some utilities to sort of print out results, not very important. So let's let's head over to the first task. And so here we just going to look at text-only conversation, and we're going to ask it a funny question, who is Victor DBA and what is he known for? So if we run that, can look at the response. So here it says like Victor DBA is a Nigerian-born American scientist, says a lot of things, makes up all kinds of stuff. None of this is correct. This is just a reminder that models at this size, just because how small they are, you probably should not be using them for factual queries or factual use cases. And the actual the right thing to do here would be to instead give it context. So in this case, what I've done is that I went to my website and I took in all of the text and I added that as context in the first message. Then I asked it who is Victor DBA, what is he known for? And we can look at the response. So here is like, Victor DBA is an expert in applied machine learning, he's a researcher at Microsoft, he's here, all of his papers, all of that. And all of this is all correct. I think it sort of looked at the important tidy parts of that text, and actually the text there is actually a message, a bunch of stuff, really unorganized, but the model is able to sort of look through all of that, come up with a sensible summary, which makes sense. And all of that took about 11 seconds on this particular machine. Okay, all good. We give it a win there. Next we head over to image description. And so here I have a couple of images. And so this is an image from a blog post I wrote a while ago, and we'll see what the image looks so far like. And what we just do is that we give it as the first message in the prompt, and then we tell it what is shown in this image. And this is what the image looks like. It's just like an illustration from an article I wrote about like AI fatigue. And this is actually not particularly like a naturally occurring image, but let's see how the model describes that. And so here it says the image depicts a man sitting on the floor with a large battery pack on his head, which kind of makes sense, connected to a power outlet, give her symbols and numbers floating around him and it reads, your search capacity is depleted, depleted. That makes sense. Pretty decent OCR, not very hard, but all fairly enough for a fairly small model, and this took about 4 seconds. Let's see. The next thing we head over to another type of image. And so here again, an abstract kind of image. And let's see how the model does. It says the image depicts a man running on a treadmill, while papers labeled new model updates, which is kind of correct, new model, updates, show, vome, all of that. It's kind of flying off the treadmill and onto the floor. Demands appears to be in a hurry or stressed, which kind of makes sense. It's exactly in the spirit of the illustration here. I gave it another pass, pretty good. The next thing would be just a little bit more challenging. And so here we take a snapshot from a website with just a bunch of text. And so this is a technical specification for a smartphone. And essentially we want the model to sort of extract all of this text. And the query here is extract all the text from this image and render it in a neat markdown file. And this is what comes out of the model, just a lot of text in a markdown file.
